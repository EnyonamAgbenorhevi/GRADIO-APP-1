# CREATING WEB APP FOR CLASSIFICATION

The objective of this undertaking is to launch an application for the classification model I developed. I opted for a Logistic Regression model integrated within a pipeline.

- The Logistic Regression Pipeline model is accessible within the model directory.
- The source code is available within the src directory.
- The necessary CSV files are located in the data frames folder.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the requirements.txt file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
import all the necessary library names. eg import Gradio as gr
```
